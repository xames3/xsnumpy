A personal pet-project of mine to try and implement the basic and bare-
bones functionality of NumPy just using pure Python. This module is a
testament to the richness of NumPy's design. By reimplementing its core
features in a self-contained and minimalistic fashion, this project
aims to::

    - Provide an educational tool for those seeking to understand array
      mechanics.
    - Serve as a lightweight alternative for environments where
      dependencies must be minimized.
    - Encourage developers to explore the intricacies of
      multidimensional array computation.

This `xsnumpy` project acknowledges the incredible contributions of the
NumPy team and community over decades of development. While this module
reimagines NumPy's functionality, it owes its design, inspiration, and
motivation to the pioneering work of the NumPy developers. This module
is not a replacement for NumPy but an homage to its brilliance and an
opportunity to explore its concepts from the ground up.
