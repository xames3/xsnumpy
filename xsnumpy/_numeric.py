xsNumPy Array Functions

This module provides essential array creation and initialization
utilities for the `xsnumpy` package. It contains a suite of functions
designed to construct and populate `ndarray` objects with various
patterns and values, mimicking the functionality of NumPy's core array
creation routines.

This module serves as the foundation for generating arrays with specific
shapes, patterns, and values. These utilities are essential for
initializing numerical data structures, enabling users to quickly
prototype and perform computations without the need for manual data
entry. Inspired by NumPy's array creation APIs, this module brings
similar functionality to `xsnumpy` with a focus on educational clarity,
pure Python implementation, and modular design.

The following functions are implemented in this module::

    - Array Creation Functions
    - Pattern-Based Array Functions
    - Array Transformation Functions

This module is designed to balance functionality and clarity, making it
both a practical tool and an educational resource. Key principles
guiding its implementation include::

    - Consistency: Functions follow predictable naming conventions and
      parameter usage, ensuring a seamless experience for users familiar
      with NumPy.
    - Flexibility: Support for multiple data types, shapes, and memory
      layouts.
    - Simplicity: Implementations prioritize readability and modularity,
      enabling users to explore and extend functionality with ease.
    - Educational Value: As part of the `xsnumpy` project, this module
      emphasizes the learning of array mechanics and API design.

The array creation functions in this module are ideal for::

    - Initializing arrays for numerical computations.
    - Creating test datasets for algorithm development.
    - Prototyping applications that require structured numerical data.
    - Exploring the mechanics of multidimensional array creation in Python.

The implementations in this module are not optimized for performance and
are intended for learning and exploratory purposes. For production-grade
numerical computation, consider using NumPy directly.
