xsNumPy DType Implementation

This module provides the foundational implementation of the
`xsnumpy._core._dtype` system, enabling flexible and type-safe handling
of data types within the xsNumPy library. A robust and extensible data
type system is a critical component of any numerical computing library,
as it facilitates precise control over the representation, manipulation,
and conversion of data.

The module defines a set of core data types and their properties,
encapsulated using a lightweight and efficient structure. Each data type
is represented as a named tuple containing attributes that describe its
kind (e.g., integer, floating point, boolean), name, and size in memory.
These attributes are designed to align with common conventions found in
numerical computing and scientific programming, ensuring familiarity and
ease of use for developers.

Additionally, the module includes utilities for converting between
different representations of data types. The `_convert_dtype` function
allows seamless translation of type specifications between formats such
as `numpy` strings, `ctypes`, and short notations. This functionality
ensures interoperability with external libraries and underlying
system-level type representations, making it easier to integrate
xsNumPy into diverse computational workflows.
